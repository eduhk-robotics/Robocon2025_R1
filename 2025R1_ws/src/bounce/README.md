Bounce ROS Package
This ROS 2 package (bounce) implements a joystick-controlled bounce mechanism with two nodes: bounce_control_node and bounce_steps_node.
Overview

bounce_control_node: Subscribes to joystick_input (sensor_msgs/Joy), extracts the LB button (buttons[4]), and publishes a boolean start_bounce to the bounce_control topic (std_msgs/Bool).
bounce_steps_node: Subscribes to bounce_control. When start_bounce is True, it executes a sequence of steps controlling three outputs:
Step1 (Rack): Controls the rack, published to step1 (std_msgs/Bool).
Step2 (Claw): Controls the claw, published to step2 (std_msgs/Bool).
Step3 (Bouncer): Controls the bouncer, published to step3 (std_msgs/Bool).



Step Sequence
When start_bounce is True:

Step1 (Rack): Set high.
Wait 0.5 seconds.
Step2 (Claw): Set high, Step3 (Bouncer): Set high.
Step3 (Bouncer): Immediately set low.
Wait 0.2 seconds, Step2 (Claw): Set low.
Wait 0.2 seconds, Step1 (Rack): Set low.

Installation

Clone the package into your ROS 2 workspace:mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
# Copy bounce package here


Build the workspace:cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build


Source the workspace:source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash



Running
Launch both nodes:
ros2 launch bounce bounce_launch.py

Testing
Publish a joystick input to trigger the sequence:
ros2 topic pub /joystick_input sensor_msgs/Joy "{buttons: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]}" --once

Monitor outputs:
ros2 topic echo /step1
ros2 topic echo /step2
ros2 topic echo /step3

Dependencies

ROS 2 (e.g., Humble)
rclpy
std_msgs
sensor_msgs

Notes

Assumes LB button is buttons[4] in Joy message.
Uses time.sleep for timing; consider ROS timers for production.
Modify bounce_steps_node.py for hardware-specific control (e.g., GPIO).
